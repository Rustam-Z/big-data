- **High availability**: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

- **Scalability**: Apps in the cloud can scale vertically and horizontally:
 - Scale vertically to increase compute capacity by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
 - Scaling horizontally increases compute capacity by adding instances of resources, such as adding VMs to the configuration.

- **Elasticity**: You can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so your apps always have the resources they need

- **Agility**: Deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as your app requirements change.

- **Geo-distribution**: You can deploy apps and data to regional datacenters around the globe, thereby ensuring that your customers always have the best performance in their region.

- **Disaster recovery**: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your apps with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event of disaster.

- Cloud service models:
    - Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) - is the most flexible cloud service because you have control to configure and manage the hardware running your application.. Good for rapid deployment of new compute devices.
    - Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) - cloud provider manages virtual machines and networking resources. Here developers can upload their web applications, without having to worry about the physical hardware and software requirements. *Azure App Services*
    - Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) - cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. *Microsoft Office 365*
